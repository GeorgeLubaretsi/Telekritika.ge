PHILOSOPHY
----------
In the last year of being an active member of Elgg community, I have noticed that many Elgg site owners are in need of plugins and features that are similar in nature. 
It is my observation that most plugin within the Elgg community have a narrow approach, trying to solve only a certain aspect of the problem in point. This led me to believe that a new approach is required.
With hypeJunction I hope to create a wide set of plugins that address a problem as a whole and can be used within any site despite site specifics and project requirements. The main distinction of hypeJunction plugins is that they are universal in nature, yet allow for easy project-specific customizations.

hypeJunctions is also trying to address the problem of lacking funding within a GPL community, that Elgg is. Plugin development costs are rather high and not many can afford building a plugin from scratch. In hypeJunction Club, the cost is distributed amongs all members, thus making it interesting and affordable for them to acquire new features that would otherwise be inaccessible.
